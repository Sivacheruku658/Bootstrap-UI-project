# Bootstrap UI project â€” UI Explorer

A pastel-themed Bootstrap 5 practice project with Home, About and Contact pages. Ready to deploy on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## How to run locally
1. Clone or copy files into a folder
2. Open index.html in your browser

## Deploy
- Push to GitHub and enable Pages, or drag-and-drop the folder into Netlify deploy.

## Notes
- Form is static. For a working contact form, connect a backend or use Formspree/Netlify Forms.
- I used subtle CSS animations and IntersectionObserver for reveal effects.
